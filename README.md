# SecureChat
Secure messaging application. Users can create channels and add an unlimited amount of users. For personal channels with only 2 users you can start Video and Audio calls using WebRTC. Users create RSA-4096 public and private keys upon registration that they use to encrypt / decrypt channel AES-256 keys. This way the user only has to encrypt one message and send that rather than encrypting one message for each user in the channel. Application built using React and Redux. Another version of the application uses Electron.js for a desktop app experience: https://github.com/Mastermind-Group/SecureChat. App is deployed using Netlify: https://securechatapp.us/
